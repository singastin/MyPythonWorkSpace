     <h1><u><b><br>Sport</b></u></h1>
     <h2><u>Football</u></h2>
     <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".</p>

     <h3><strong><br><br><br><u>RULES</u></strong></h3>
     <p>Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.[12]
        A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
        Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
        Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
        The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
        Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.
        In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.</p>
